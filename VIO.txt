# Visual Inertial Odometry
--------------------------

## Where are we right now ?

- Visual Part is working.
	[ We get Rotational Matrix [R] and translation vector [t].. ]
	however, we use the groud truth for estimating the absolute scale.
	which is not true in real life. (no ground truth available)
	So, this way we can't get the absolute scale.

- What can we do ?
	Well, the good thing is that we don't have just one sensor.
	We can use IMU data as well as GPS data and fuse these sensors together for calculating the scale.
	But, GPS doesn't have that much accuracy. (2 m - 10 m)

	IMU is the better option. There are different variaties of IMU sensors. (Basic Class : Gyros and Magnetometers) 


1. Visual Odometry
--------------------

	- Get first image | Find good features to track
	- Get second image | Find good features to track
	- Match Featrues from image 1 onto image 2
	- Run RANSAC to find Essential Matrix
	- Decompose Essential Matrix into Rotational Matrix and Translation vector
	- Scale calculations
			a) Using Ground Truth - not practical
			b) Sensor Fusion with IMU
